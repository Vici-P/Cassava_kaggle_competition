The world population is growing steadily and we need more and more food, so it is important to use the cultivated area efficiently. 
This model development focuses on the classification of diseases from cassava, but it can also form a good basis for identifying diseases in other plants based on the images of the leaves. 

The model should be able to classify 4 different diseases based on the pictures of the leaves. The fifth category is intended to classify healthy leaves. Farmers may be able to quickly identify diseased plants, potentially saving their crops before they inflict irreparable damage. As an added challenge, effective solutions for farmers must perform well under significant constraints, since African farmers may only have access to mobile-quality cameras with low-bandwidth.

Submissions will be evaluated based on their categorization accuracy.  

I have read various articles on the subject and based on them i will try different approaches in the development of models.
